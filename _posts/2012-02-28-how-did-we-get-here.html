So how did we get here? Steph has been looking for a job in the UK for some time, she is a health care professional and the NHS is not packed with opportunities just at the moment. I had been working at my previous employment for three years and I was ready for a change, I had thought a change of team or maybe a change of job.</p>  <p>Steph was getting nowhere finding a job that was going to engage and interest her and somehow (I will let her try and remember how) New Zealand was on the agenda. At first last summer the idea was floated as a theoretical possibility however by September 2011 we were seriously thinking about the logistics of moving across the planet. By the first week in February 2012 we were both in employment and we had a house and a car.</p>  <p>This blog is about how this came to be and things we noticed and learnt along the way.</p>
