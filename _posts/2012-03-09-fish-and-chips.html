We have been out for fish and chips on two weekend evening already. The first time was the weekend that the container arrived, we drove up the coast to Plimmerton and ate fish and chips on the beach.</p>  <p>It was very sweet. The chips were very nice, cooked in bran rice oil, which we are assured by the shop is very healthy. Vinegar was not in evidence however salt was very liberally applied.</p>  <p>The thing that is odd is the fish. I’ve noticed this before, when travelling meat – like lamb and beef stays the same (well in na<a href="/images/P1010828_2.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="P1010828" border="0" alt="P1010828" align="right" src="/images/P1010828_thumb_2.jpg" width="244" height="184" /></a>me at least) but all the fish names are completely weird. Anyway Hoki and Chips on the beach looking over the bay to Whitby was very nice.</p>  <p>Then this weekend we went to the <a href="http://www.wellington.govt.nz/services/events/annuals/summer/details/asbsunset.html">sunset concert</a> in Shortland park. The sky was amazing in the sunset and the locval fish and chip shop produced some very good fish and chips so we could chill on the grass and listen to the music.</p>
