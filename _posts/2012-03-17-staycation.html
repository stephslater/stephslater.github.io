<p>We have been here long enough now that we can just about do something other than organise our life. And to be honest its about time we got out to see this country that we have come all this way to live in.</p>  <p>I knew there was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staycation">word for this</a>. We have no daisy. The camper van is getting her WOF (this like a UK MOT) and she needs some rust work to be done so we cannot go away this weekend so we are doing the staycation thing.</p>  <p>Its basically a weekend of three walks. Ahhh there is the other thing. When Steph arrived she got a contract for a nine day fortnight. So I thought that on a clean slate I would try something similar. In general I think the IT industry in NZ has not really embraced this concept but I did manage to get a job from an enlightened employer and every alternate weekend is a long weekend for us. And luckily for us the weekend has been a gloriously sunny one.</p>  <p>So Friday we had to go into Wellington and drop our bikes off for a service. We then walked out the back of Wellington and up to the botanical gardens, with a great view across the city.</p>  <p><a href="/images/welli2_stitch.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 10px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="welli2_stitch" border="0" alt="welli2_stitch" src="/images/welli2_stitch_thumb.jpg" width="471" height="195" /></a></p>  <p>Then down into the park, for yet another <a href="http://www.wellington.govt.nz/services/events/annuals/summer/details/asbgardens.html">sunset concert</a>, we do seem to making a <a href="/blog/2012/03/09/fish-and-chips.aspx">habit of these concerts</a>, this time we listened with a big bag of kettle crisps and a chilled chardonnay.</p>  <p><a href="/images/p1010911.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 10px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="p1010911" border="0" alt="p1010911" align="right" src="/images/p1010911_thumb.jpg" width="263" height="198" /></a></p>  <p>saturday we did the skyline walk again. the top banner of this site is from our first trip along the skyline. this time it was quite windy (well it is wellington) and rather up and down but four hours later we were in karori and then a quick bus ride into town to get our bikes and then we pedalled back along the waterfront just in time to see the <a href="http://www.dragonboat.org.nz/page/home.html">dragon boat races</a> which just seemed to be a massive city wide party. After all this exercise we decided that maybe we would let the train take the strain and take us up the hill to Johnsonville.</p>  <p><a href="/images/P1010928.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 10px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="P1010928" border="0" alt="P1010928" align="right" src="/images/P1010928_thumb.jpg" width="264" height="199" /></a></p>  <p>Sunday we went up to Porirua, where Steph works and <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=204912407013699852461.0004bb7eef6cc8b65a2dc&amp;msa=0">walked around the coastline of the bay</a>, watching the windsurfers and kite surfers enjoying the sun and the wind in equal measure. So now we are here with tired legs with dinner cooking and the sun going down but we have seen a little of the area and who knows when Daisy returns we will go further afield.</p>
