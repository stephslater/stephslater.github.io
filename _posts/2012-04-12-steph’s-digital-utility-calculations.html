<p>A while ago we were talking to an agent about renting out property in the UK, they said that they would ensure that the tenant was properly setup for the utilities: Gas, Electricity, Internet… Wow, things have moved on since I was a student and renting a flat, since when was Internet regarded as a utility?</p>  <p>Well I don’t know when it happened, but now having started renting here in NZ I know that it just is. We ensured that Gas, Electricity and Internet were all setup the day we moved in.</p>  <h3>Which brings me to costs</h3>  <p>To get the internet connected here costs $95 a month, we have <a href="http://www.vodafone.co.nz/naked-broadband/">gone with Vodafone</a> and <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/6446889/Fry-broadband-rant-a-misunderstanding">unlike Steven Fry</a> I find the internet to be fast and reliable, in fact it’s probably faster here than in the UK. For that we get 20GB a month and I get a phone SIM that pretty much gives me free calls and data, actually the data is limited to 1.2GB a month for the first 6 months and 250MB after that. I get 100 minutes of NZ calls and 1,000 to my NZ “best mate” (Steph). I don’t really use a phone as a phone very much so that’s fine. However it comes out at $1,140 a year for the internet.</p>  <h3>Which brings me to Steph’s comparison calculation</h3>  <p>When I complained to Steph that this seemed very expensive by comparison to the UK where broadband can be bought for £6 a month. Steph suggested that maybe the comparison would work better if I compared “total entertainment packages”. That is regard internet and TV as one package.</p>  <p>In the UK we paid £12 a month for Internet (£144 pa), but we also paid £32 a quarter for line rental (running total £272 pa), I would estimate about £10 a month for my PAYG SIM phone and data, gives me a running total of £392 pa. If we now add in the TV license we get £577 pa (there is no TV license in NZ).</p>  <p>The exchange rate is roughly £1 = $2 which means that in the UK we were paying roughly $1,154 pa.</p>  <p>It’s not completely like for like as we had 60GB of broadband data in the UK and only 20GB here but in NZ I get a lot more mobile data. I guess it’s a bit odd to compare like this but when I do I would guess that superficially things do seem a lot more expensive in NZ however in this case I would guess that our total cost is about the same.</p>
