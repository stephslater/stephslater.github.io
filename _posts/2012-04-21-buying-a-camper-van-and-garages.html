<p>I had decided that we would try having a campervan as our only vehicle in New Zealand. I am the only driver and we have never done much driving in the week as we like to cycle to work. Derek was not very keen living in a campervan until we rented a house, but in the end he acquiesced.</p>
<p>When we arrived I had a look at <a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz">Trade Me</a> and there is also a car sale at the horse race track in Auckland, every Sunday. In the end we brought at the race track.</p>
<p><a href="/images/P1010623.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 5px 0px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="P1010623" src="/images/P1010623_thumb.jpg" alt="P1010623" width="282" height="215" align="left" border="0" /></a>We brought &ldquo;Daisy&rdquo;. She is a Toyota Hiace. It was a decision between two campervans one cheaper but older and one more expensive but newer. We went for the older one as we liked the layout inside and we want it for one year to decide if it is going to work just having a campervan. At the sale you can pay for an inspection, the guy who did ours summarised with &ldquo;you take a chance and a dance&rdquo;. Mechanically she was good but she had rust. The couple we brought off split the cost of the inspection and would have kept the report is we had then decided not to buy Daisy.</p>
<p>In NZ you have to have an MOT (here a WOF, Warrant of Fitness) every six months. Since the road death rate is so high in NZ they have become more picky about rust. I have now found that is actually rust within 15cm of any key fixture or joint. Daisy&rsquo;s WOF was due 24th Mar, in theory with her age she should have been sold with six months WOF. In hindsight I would have had Daisy WOF&rsquo;d rather than pay for the inspection at the sale, but then she would have failed as she had a cracked rear light (common as vans get reversed into unseen objects &ndash; not me yet!)</p>
<p>So we set off from Auckland to Wellington. Our luck but on the journey Daisy developed a hole in the exhaust. I do question that if the inspector had shaken the exhaust he would have seen how much is was patched!! I could get pulled by the police for the exhaust.</p>
<h1>My experience of one recommended garage</h1>
<p>So I took Daisy to the garage for an estimate of the cost to repair on 27th Jan &ndash; but actually need to know if it is worth doing the repair &ndash; i.e. will Daisy get through her WOF 3 more times and at what cost?</p>
<p>So the WOF was booked for 17th Feb but the parts did not turn up on time.</p>
<p>Then on 2nd Mar - wrong parts. Window winder for the passenger not the driver&rsquo;s side AND the wrong door lock!!!! Oh and we were just checking and there is some rust that will stop it getting through its WOF.</p>
<p>The rust man cannot do it until 21st Mar and we cannot drive the van until it has a WOF!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>So what happened to "could you just check to see if it will get through it's WOF before I decide if it is worth spending any money on it", "Please check especially for rust"</p>
<p>So the rust will cost $600. The man at the garage is surprised that is all it will cost; he thought it looked much worse - so why did he not see it in the first place!!!!</p>
<p>I picked up the free courtesy car on 8th Mar - until the 21st!!</p>
<p>I am told that this is a bit of a New Zealand thing. We keep coming over and asking for things they have never heard of before. The example I was going to the dentist for a check up. You sit in the chair and the dentist asks what you want. "Just check my teeth are OK". The dentist will ask what, specifically, you want checking. So basically you find an English dentist who understands. Other people at work have had very similar experiences with the length of time it takes to get cars fixed.</p>
<p>Daisy is now back and in fantastic condition, quiet and no critical rust. She has saved us money on getting from Auckland, accommodation and moving furniture but Daisy feels a bit like pass the parcel to me. She will keep going and eventually somebody will be left with a bill that is not worth paying. This can be said for any car.</p>
<h1>General Campervan notes</h1>
<p>In New Zealand cars are going to be older and will have done far more KM. 240,000km is not unusual. If you go for diesel you have to pay a road tax for the KM that you travel, bought in advance.</p>
<p>Any electrics in a camper van will need an electrical check. If built in to the camper you have to pay for an eWOF, even if you are using a standalone hookup lead this needs to be checked and stickered as well. They are getting stricter on this too.</p>
<p>One thing I found useful was trying to get an insurance quote through the AA. In the end they would not insure me as I did not have a New Zealand driving licence (this is easy via an AA office &ndash; I have not changed mine yet). They did value the vehicle I was trying to buy. This helped when I wanted to put an offer in. It made me realise that everything I saw on &ldquo;Trade Me&rdquo; or at the car sale was overpriced. You think you are getting lots of extras with the bedding, pans and stove, but how much would that really add up to. Also check the extras. The AA magazines are very useful, but free. The plastic containers, well if you live here they will be free too (ice cream containers are excellent).</p>
<p>So look on Trade Me before you come, often these are the vehicles that you will see at the car sales. Then try to get an insurance quote and that will tell you how much the insurers value the vehicle for. Travellers do maintenance and repairs on these vehicles and expect to make that money back, but this should not mean you have to pay for it. Really take off those &ldquo;rose tinted glasses&rdquo; and check for rust, check the oil level, check the windows wind up and down and check the water stays in the windscreen water bottle.</p>
<p>A small thing like a broken tail light will mean that it will fail its WOF and unless you know a bit about cars then it costs in TIME and money to get this done in a garage.</p>
<p>Happy driving, well that is another blog all of its own!!!</p>
