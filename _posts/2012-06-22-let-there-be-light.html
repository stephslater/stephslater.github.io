One of the things that made a big impact on me is not peculiar to New Zealand but is new to me.</p>  <p>The house we have rented has a light pipe in the bathroom ceiling. Its a very simple but effective device that basically just reflects light into the room, I have seen them on TV but never lived with one and I have to say its so effective that even though the bathroom has no window we never turn the light on during the day. In fact the only drawback is that for the first couple of months I kept trying to turn the light off every time I passed the door even though it wasn't on.</p>
