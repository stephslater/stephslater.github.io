<p>It feels as though we are making some progress, it also feels as though we are getting through winter &ndash; sorry but I guess that for most of you that means you are getting through summer. We have had three gloriously sunny weekends in a row.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago we went off on our travels in Daisy again, we went over the hill to <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=204912407013699852461.0004c0fdb2139bb09dabd&amp;msa=0" target="_blank">Martinborogh in the Waiarapa</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="float: right;" src="/images/2012/8/P1020257.JPG" alt="" width="263" height="198" />We were returning to see John the man who had started to teach us picture framing. The first time we went we&nbsp;did two pictures, this time we wanted to try and do more as we had printed a set of 11 photos from going to India last year. We thought doing 9 in a day was a bit ambitious but John was a man on a mission and was determined that we should finish&nbsp;even if he had to cut the glass for us. It was fun, we even managed to find time to sit and chill in the sunshine and eat Parkin (Steph baked) We did complete all the pictures and we are getting better at this, this time there was no bruising to the wood. That evening we went to the Circus cinema, very pleasant big leather seats and a glass of red, to see the Avengers and it was a great, very silly romp.</p>
<p>This time we brought our bikes in Daisy &ndash; the plan was to get some exercise and rehab. I have been suffering some tweaked muscles stiffness in my back since I got here so Steph suggested I see one of the physio&rsquo;s where she works. I saw Garry who basically attacked me as only a physio can and then told me that he was surprised I could walk given my lack of quad muscles. Apparently I have been doing it (walking) all wrong&nbsp;for years and that combined with short hip flexors (whatever they are) meant that my legs were going to fall off at any time. He gave me a number of exercises and Steph got into the swing of things by finding an exercise / torture device on trade.me (sort of a Kiwi eBay).</p>

<p>&nbsp;I have to say that I do feel much better now I am attempting to walk &ldquo;properly&rdquo; and I am nearly ready to resume cycling to work. Anyway for this weekend we <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=204912407013699852461.0004c5dd5af5efa94d8cb&amp;msa=0" target="_blank">cycled around in the sun</a>, visited some vineyards and played petanque.</p>
<p>We then rushed home to put our pictures up &ndash; its so nice to feel as though we have moved in.</p>

<p>The weekend after this we were experimenting with commuter cycling around Wellington. We went up the coast to Plimmerton, its an area that is very pretty, the weather is apparently better (sunnier and less windy) then Wellington and we can cycle together down the coast to Steph&rsquo;s work and then I could catch the train into Wellington. I was a bit concerned that it would just be a cycle along what is basically a dual carriageway, however it was a stunning cycle, <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=204912407013699852461.0004c5dd576b572b841bc&amp;msa=0" target="_blank">the path</a> wanders into parks and along the shore and is kept away from the road.</p>
<p>We also tried cycling into Wellington and catching the train home &ndash; until I am back to fitness I think it would be prudent as the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=204912407013699852461.0004b976a131f2434821c&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=-41.253161,174.800034&amp;spn=0.090726,0.165653&amp;iwloc=0004b976a1a8617f504a8" target="_blank">cycle home is a bit steep</a>.&nbsp;Its great all the trains on our line can take 6 cycles in special racks in the carriage even in rush hour (though at the moment I am having trouble leaving the office before the end of rush hour)&nbsp;It was such a sunny day we had a coffee lying on day beds above the harbour. Very nice.</p>

<p>Stephs ex-boss Catherine and family came around for tea, we made paper planes with her daughter (Jess who is six). It was a very pleasant evening just chatting and catching up &ndash; we haven&rsquo;t seen them in a month.</p>
<p>We have been to the cinema a lot recently, it&rsquo;s the film festival at the moment. We are seeing lots of stuff that is completely new to me like &ldquo;Rampart&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sightseers&rdquo; (described as a Natural Born Killers in the lake district).&nbsp;Last week was a super short week, only three days, Friday was our regular day off and Thursday was <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/wdcnz/" target="_blank">WDCNZ</a> (a techie conference in Wellington sponsored by work, and we all got to go) It was good fun</p>
<p><img style="float: left;" src="/images/2012/8/IMAG0110.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="263" />On Saturday we stayed in bed and read our books, it was lovely. I made breakfast and listened to some of the cricket and then we had tea and toast in bed and just read until mid afternoon. I made some bread and soup and we watched the West Wing &ndash; very chilled.</p>
<p>On Sunday we continued the cycle trail and cycled up the Hutt Valley, It was very pretty, very flat (elevation gain of 30m) and very sunny and warm &ndash; I was cycling in shorts!</p>
<p>We have been trying to keep up with the Olympics but we don&rsquo;t really watch a lot of TV so we keep getting behind &ndash; and that&rsquo;s with the limited NZ coverage which seems to concentrate on things the Kiwis are good at &ndash; equestrian, rowing etc. It sounds as though team GB are doing rather well. Is everyone in the UK getting into the Olympics? Have people been able to get tickets.</p>
<p>So we are not quite through winter but it does feel as though we are getting there. Work is still busy but I have a new member of staff starting and an old one returning at the beginning of September so there is light at the end of the tunnel. Steph may be getting a new member of staff that will really help with her work load.</p>
